# College-Ranking-Linear-Regression
Using Linear Regression to explain college rankings as a function of university faculty attributes

# Project Summary:
* Used simple linear regression to estimate of effect of professor salary, student-to-faculty-ratio and percent female faculty on university ranking.

# Code and Resources Used:
* Python Version: 3.9.3
* Packages: pandas, matplotlib, statsmodels.api, statsmodels.iolib.summary2, seaborn
* Linear Regression Article: https://python.quantecon.org/ols.html
* Text: Introduction to Econmetrics, Stock and Watson
